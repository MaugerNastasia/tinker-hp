TODO LIST FOR PIMD IMPLEMENTATION

1) BASIC IMPLEMENTATION

- redefine COMM_TINKER (like COMM_BEAD in CPU implementation)
- rename new modules to MOD_*.f
- port baoabpi to GPU 
    - derivs only on GPU
    - check where are the energies (transfer to pi variables)
    - barostat ?
- check if mdstatpi has access to everything on CPU
- prtdynbeads / prtxyzbeads ?

2) OPTIMIZATION

- can we put everything on GPU (less transfer in pushbead/initbead) ?
- can the tasks of ranktot 0 be parallelized on GPU ? (probably yes !)

3) MORE FEATURES

- implement IR SPECTRA (need some QTB routines => port QTB ?)
